Hello!
Thank you for using Tasil!
Follow these instructions to ensure Tasil works properly:

1. Place the Tasil folder in the same path as your main file.
2. Do not change any file or folder names within the Tasil folder (this may corrupt Tasil and cause your code to malfunction).

Please note that Tasil is quite limited for Linux users, as the creator of Tasil (me) does not have the Linux operating systemðŸ˜”
